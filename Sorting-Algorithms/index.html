                    <h2>Selection Sort</h2>
                    <p>Selection sort is a sorting algorithm, specifically an in-place comparison sort. It has O(n2) time complexity, making it inefficient on large lists, and generally performs worse than the similar insertion sort. Selection sort is noted for its simplicity, and it has performance advantages over more complicated algorithms in certain situations, particularly where auxiliary memory is limited.</p>

                    <h2>Bubble Sort</h2>
                    <p>Bubble sort, sometimes referred to as sinking sort, is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list to be sorted, compares each pair of adjacent items and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until no swaps are needed, which indicates that the list is sorted.</p>

                    <h2>Insertion Sort</h2>
                    <p>Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array (or list) one item at a time. It is much less efficient on large lists than more advanced algorithms such as quicksort, heapsort, or merge sort.</p>

                    <h2>Merge Sort</h2>
                    <p>Merge sort is an efficient, general-purpose, comparison-based sorting algorithm. Most implementations produce a stable sort, which means that the order of equal elements is the same in the input and output. Merge sort is a divide and conquer algorithm that was invented by John von Neumann in 1945.</p>

                    <h2>Counting Sort</h2>
                    <p>Counting Sort is an efficient algorithm for sorting an array of elements that each have a nonnegative integer key, for example, an array, sometimes called a list, of positive integers could have keys that are just the value of the integer as the key, or a list of words could have keys assigned to them by some scheme mapping the alphabet to integers that represent the position of the letter in the alphabet.</p>

                    <h2>Radix Sort</h2>
                    <p>Radix sort is a non-comparative sorting algorithm. It avoids comparison by creating and distributing elements into buckets according to their radix. For elements with more than one significant digit, this bucketing process is repeated for each digit, while preserving the ordering of the prior step, until all digits have been considered.</p>

                    <h2>Bucket Sort</h2>
                    <p>Bucket sort, or bin sort, is a sorting algorithm that works by distributing the elements of an array into a number of buckets. Each bucket is then sorted individually, either using a different sorting algorithm, or by recursively applying the bucket sorting algorithm.</p>

                    <h2>Heap Sort</h2>
                    <p>Heap sort is a comparison-based sorting algorithm. Heap sort can be thought of as an improved selection sort: like that algorithm, it divides its input into a sorted and an unsorted region, and it iteratively shrinks the unsorted region by extracting the largest element from it and inserting it into the sorted region.</p>

                    <h2>Shell Sort</h2>
                    <p>Shell sort, also known as Shell's method, is an in-place comparison sort. It can be seen as either a generalization of sorting by exchange (bubble sort) or sorting by insertion (insertion sort). The method starts by sorting pairs of elements far apart from each other, then progressively reducing the gap between elements to be compared.</p>
