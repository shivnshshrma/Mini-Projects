# Sorting Algorithm Visualization

This is a web-based project that visualizes various sorting algorithms. It provides a visual representation of how different sorting algorithms work and can be used as an educational tool to understand their behavior.

## Features

- Visualization of popular sorting algorithms, including Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Quick Sort, and more.
- Adjustable input data size for sorting.
- Speed control for visualizations.
- User-friendly interface for selecting and comparing sorting algorithms.
- Detailed explanations of each sorting algorithm's operation.

## Demo

You can see a live demo of the project [here](https://your-demo-link.com).
